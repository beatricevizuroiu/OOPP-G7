# CODE OF CONDUCT

## OVERVIEW
At OOP Project Group 7 ("the Team") we require that all of our team members conduct themselves according to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and behaviour when dealing with our clients, colleagues, and other stakeholders. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, full compliance with all legal obligations imposed by statute or any other source of law. This Code establishes the standards of behaviour that must be met by all team members. Where these standards are not met, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. In cases where the breach involves serious misconduct, this will be handled by the responsible TA.

## OPERATION
The purpose of this policy is to make it clear what the Team expects from team members, and team members are required to be familiar with and comply with the terms of this policy at all times. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, handled by the responsible TA.
In so far as this policy imposes any obligations on the Team, those obligations are not contractual and do not give rise to any contractual rights. To the extent that this policy describes benefits and entitlements for team members, they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual.
The Team may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time, with the approval of the responsible TA.

## STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
