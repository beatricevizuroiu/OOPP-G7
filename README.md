## Description of project
RaisedHand is a tool for lecturers to receive questions from their students during (online) lectures. In addition, we offer some extra features that allow the lecturers to get more organized feedback from their students.

### Features
- Receive questions from your students.
- Send polls to your students.
- Let the students attending the lecture inform you on whether you are going too fast or too slow through out the course material. 
- Do not allow students to send questions, answer polls or inform you about your speed by banning them.
- Delete questions from students.
- Edit questions.
- Assign trusted users permission to moderate the activity to help keep the room clean.

## How to run it
In this section you will find instructions on how to run the client and server parts of this project.

### Client
Follow the below instructions to run the client program.

#### Linux & Mac OS
```sh
# Clone the git repo into the OOPP-G7 folder.
git clone git@gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl:cse1105/2020-2021/team-repositories/oopp-group-07/repository-template.git OOPP-G7

# Go into the folder we just cloned.
cd OOPP-G7/

# Compile a binary from the source code.
./gradlew :client:build

# Move the binary into a more managable folder.
mv client/build/libs/client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar client.jar

# Start the client.
java -jar client.jar

# If you want to connect to a specific server (other then the default localhost:8080) you can specify it as a command line argument to the client.
java -jar client.jar "http://alternative.server.example.com:8080" 
```

#### Windows
```bat
REM Clone the git repo into the OOPP-G7 folder.
git clone git@gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl:cse1105/2020-2021/team-repositories/oopp-group-07/repository-template.git OOPP-G7

REM Go into the folder we just cloned.
cd OOPP-G7\

REM Compile a binary from the source code.
gradlew :client:build

REM Move the binary into a more managable folder.
move client\build\libs\client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar client.jar

REM Start the client.
java -jar client.jar
```

### Server
Follow the below instructions to run the server program.

#### Windows
The server is currently only supported on Linux and Mac OS so Windows users will have to install a WSL distro. Additionally they also want to install docker in some way. Whether that is through the Windows installer or via WSL itself.

#### Linux & Mac OS
Make sure docker and docker-compose are installed prior to following any of these steps.
```sh
# Clone the git repo into the OOPP-G7 folder.
git clone git@gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl:cse1105/2020-2021/team-repositories/oopp-group-07/repository-template.git OOPP-G7

# Go into the folder we just cloned.
cd OOPP-G7/

# Compile a binary from the source code.
./gradlew :server:build

# Move the binary into a more managable folder.
mv server/build/libs/server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar server.jar

# Start the database.
sudo docker-compose up -d

# Start the server.
java -jar server.jar
```
