# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
- We should now be finished with aproximity 75% of the project. How far along are we?
- Do Final Buddy Check
    - Note that this Buddy Check will be graded so spend some more time 
- Presentation video
    - If you have not yet done so, film your part of the presentation. 
- Last week we did not completely finish our sprint, did we this time?
- Was our past sprint reasonable or should we change upcoming sprints?
- If all the issues of our past sprint are complete, we should have a decent usable program with a functioning User Interface resembling the final version. Does everything work as intended? Are we all happy with the current result and progress?
- Please check any open MERGE REQUESTS and see if there is anything to discuss.

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
