# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
- We should now be finished with aproximity 50% of the project. How far along are we?

- Last week we did not completely finish our sprint, did we this time?
- Was our past sprint reasonable or should we change upcoming sprints?
- If all the issues of our past sprint are complete, we should have a decent usable program with a functioning User Interface resembling the final version. Does everything work as intended? Are we all happy with the current result and progress?
- Please check any open MERGE REQUESTS and see if there is anything to discuss.

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
- Create SCRUM for this week at the end of the TA meeting
- Elements include:
	- Update Sprint plan for upcoming week if necessary (thursday after lunch)
	- Sprint (rest of the week)
	- New increment on Master Branch (Wednesday)
	- Have a Sprint review (Wednesday afternoon)
	- Have a Sprint retrospective (Thursday morning)

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
- Among our group there is quite a bit of confusion about the way we are being graded and what we have to do about it.
	- In the recent announcement we were told that we should have commits every week, yet this seems to be impossible to acchieve due to the fact that we need to keep an equal distribution of SLOC (And not of actual work done).

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
