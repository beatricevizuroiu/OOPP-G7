# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*

 - Last week we did not completely finish our sprint, did we this time?
 - Was our past sprint reasonable or should we change upcoming sprints?
 - If all of the issues of our past sprint are complete, we should have a decent usable program with a functioning User Interface resembling the final version. Does everything work as intended? Are we all happy with the current result and progress?
 - Please check any open MERGE REQUESTS and see if there is anything to discuss.
 



# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.* \
*Can be filled after the CTA meeting. TO-DO board for what we should do next week.*

 - Create SCRUM for this week at the end of the TA meeting 
 - Elements include:
    - Update **Sprint plan** for upcoming week if necessary
    (thursday after lunch)
    - **Sprint** (rest of the week)
    - New **increment** on Master Branch (Wednesday)
    - Have a **Sprint review** (Wednesday afternoon)
    - Have a **Sprint retrospective** (Thursday morning)
    


# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA

 - Our CTA diverged from the brightspace backlog earlier, saying we did not need scheduling while the brightspace backlog does mention it, does this mean we have to follow our CTA or the general backlog? 

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*


# Closing
*Now you can continue working on the project. Good luck!*
