# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*

 - We went over the agreed upon checkstyle. Is there anything anyone wants to discuss, or any question that they want to ask, regarding that?
 - Please check the MERGE REQUESTS and see if there is anything to discuss.
 - Discussion of EER Diagram:
    - Please can everyone scan and send their own personal EER Diagram (so that we can discuss them)
    - *(We will probably have to discuss and compare in detail after the TA meeting due to time limitations )*
    - General points:
        - Do we all have the same entities?
        - Do we have any weak entities?
        - Do we all have the same relationships between entities?
        - Do we have any identifying relationships?
        - Do we all have the same attributes?
        - Are any of them key, multivalued, composite or derived attributes?
 - Add requirements/issues into Gitlab (VERY IMPORTANT -> for scrum)
 - Remeber to finalize the README section with our names. (DONE)
 - Look into already installing Docker (see Brightspace for instructions)


# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.* \
*Can be filled after the CTA meeting. TO-DO board for what we should do next week.*

 - We need to start implementing a SCRUM at the end of the TA meetings (maybe for this one we should create it after the CTA meeting to have a better idea of what exactly we are supposed to achieve)
 - Elements include:
    - Finalize the **product backlog** after CTA meeting (thursday after CTA meeting)
    - Have **Sprint plan** for upcoming week
    (thursday [maybe afternoon] after CTA meeting)
    - Create **Sprint backlog** and use it to add the requirements/issues into Gitlab 
    (thursday [maybe afternoon] after CTA meeting)
    - **Sprint** (rest of the week)
    - New **increment** on Master Branch (together and date to be decided)
    - Have a **Sprint review** (date to be decided)
    - Have a **Sprint retrospective** (date to be decided)
    


# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*
 - Do we need to have a notetaker? Isn't it more beneficial that everyone is paying 100% attention to what is being discussed?

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
